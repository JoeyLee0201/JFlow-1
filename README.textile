h2. JFlow - Interactive Source-to-source Program Transformations for Flow-Based Parallelism

Emerging applications demand new parallel abstractions. Traditional parallel abstractions such as Data Parallelism and Task Parallelism, while necessary, do not fully the needs of todayâ€™s multi-threaded commercial applications. Emerging applications in the domain of recognition, mining and synthesis (RMS); image and video processing; information flow; and automatic financial trading exhibit flow-based forms of parallelism. How can we assist developers in taking advantage of such forms of parallelism?

We propose a solution based on interactive source-to-source transformations. Interactive source-to-source transformations engage the developer, i.e., the domain expert in the process of parallelizing and optimizing an application.
